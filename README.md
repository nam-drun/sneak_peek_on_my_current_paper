All results here so far are parts of the part 1 in my paper. That is, let's test different gen models on simulated data distribution and adding on the assistance of different guidance terms.

How this repository is organised when it's finished is that you will see one folder called ``gen_models`` where I test various gen models to pick out the best one for each generative modelling category. Then you will see another folder called ``causal_discover`` where finetune the best gen model in each category on a downstream regression task where there's a ground truth causal relationship between features to be found. To reflect real world setting, I allow each gen model to have assistance of guidance, such as classifier-free guidance and gradient guidance since they are universal, unlike user-specific guidance, as illustrated by figure 1 in ``Universal Guidance for Diffusion Models`` paper. Although each gen model has its own sampling procedure, just to illustrate that this to a module that can be dealt with separately from the gen model (i.e. loss function), I will also apply [Speculative Sampling for Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05370) on every other gen model. Just to be clear, Speculative Sampling is not [Rejection Sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling)
