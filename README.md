Yes, I do all these in solo research. Still, I'm grateful to get feedbacks from postdoc and phd people occasionally to keep my paper compact and concise. Here are what I intend to say:

#### Priority when designing generative model (bottom means higher priority otherwise the whole system implodes)

#### Then I talk about Stochastic Interpolant
To keep it digestible to beginner, I spend Background section to cover something that we see in everyday commercial life like histogram plot and density plot all the way to Stochastic Interpolant
